## NodeJS Sample App

This is a simple app that I use for boilerplate code for my tasks as well as personal projects.
The app runs on port defined in _`.env`_ file with 8000 as default port.

### What it includes ?

A simple structure for your backend NodeJS apps.

The structure of the app is as follows:

- index.js ( root file )
- server
  - controllers
  - middlewares
  - routes
  - tests
  - utils
  - constants

There is a _`.env.sample`_ file present in the root directory, you can use that to configure your environment variables.

### Improvements

This is still in progress project and I am learning and implementing features that I find relevant to my needs.
The following is the list of things I am yet to do:

- [ ] Add winston for logging
- [ ] Add different configs for each environment
- [ ] Add plain response and error messages
